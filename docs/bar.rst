Bar
___

Many argue over the merit of bar over foo. In order not to insult 
the barists, we included bar in the package even though everyone 
who uses it is a filthy casual and should be fired immediatley.

bar()
+++++
Returns the string 'bar'. I know, right? Useless.

Example::
    >>> import foobar
    >>> foobar.bar()
    'bar'
